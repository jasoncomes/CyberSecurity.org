<h2>What is an Information Security Analyst?</h2>
{% endsubnav_item %}
<p>Cyber security breaches are an increasing threat, as demonstrated by successful attacks against major companies like Target, Sony, Equifax, and JPMorgan Chase. As an information security analyst, you serve on the line of defense against these attacks, devising the security systems that keep sensitive data safe and preventing potential intrusions. Cyber security professionals are needed in any industry that uses computers. The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> projects an 18% increase in security analysis jobs between 2014-2024, which is above average.</p>
<h3>What Does an Information Security Analyst do?</h3>
<p>Security business analysts are virtual gatekeepers who are responsible for nearly all dimensions of a company’s digital security systems, such as designing computer networks and security procedures and testing cyber defenses for weaknesses. To be a good security specialist, you must understand the techniques that cybercriminals use and devise effective, creative solutions to combat them. You also need to stay current on advances in hacking and digital security. In the worst-case scenario, you must be prepared to control the results of security breaches and exercise effective damage control and containment practices. An effective security analyst must be technically skilled, quick thinking, able to multitask, and capable of functioning under high-stress circumstances.</p>
<h3>Common Responsibilities</h3>
<ul class="resources-columns">
 	<li><strong>Install and maintain security software</strong> A major part of cyber security involves designing, developing, and maintaining an organization’s security systems. This includes installing firewalls and fine tuning data encryption protocols. You must keep an organization’s information systems secure and constantly update them to maintain their stability.</li>
 	<li><strong>Conduct security testing</strong> To ensure that an organization’s security measures are adequate, you’re responsible for conducting tests of network security and attempting to penetrate cyber defenses just as hackers would. This type of risk assessment allows you to determine potential weaknesses and update security systems accordingly.</li>
 	<li><strong>Develop security standards and protocols</strong> Cyber security professionals must determine appropriate responses to security threats. That means creating security practices, information safety procedures, and organization-wide strategies for security breaches. You may also need to share these strategies with other employees.</li>
 	<li><strong>Research security trends</strong> The methods for cyberattacks and defensive strategies are constantly changing, and it’s up to you to stay current on the latest developments. This includes reading industry publications, attending professional conferences, and communicating with other security specialists.</li>
 	<li><strong>Communicate with other employees</strong> As a security analyst, you must communicate effectively with other company employees, many of whom lack your technical knowledge and vocabulary. This may include informing company leaders of security concerns and training other employees in basic security procedures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="jordan">Interview: How Did Your Master's in Business Analytics Change Your Career?</h2>
{% endsubnav_item %}
<div class="columns-one-third">
<div class="column">{% card type:expert title:"Chris Jordan <em>CEO at Fluency</em>" image:"https://res.cloudinary.com/highereducation/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/c_crop,g_face:center,h_200,w_300/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1514999215/BusinessAnalytics.com/Jordan_Chris.jpg" %} Chris Jordan founded Endeavor Security, a threat detection and analysis company focused on helping enterprises and governments protect sensitive networks.

{% expandable title:"What advice would you give to someone looking to begin their career in information security analytics?" active:true %}
<p>First, get involved. If you want to have a career in security, then find a way to truly be interested in it. There are a number of both professional and casual events. Each year there is Blackhat-Defcon (Las Vegas), CanSec West (Vancouver) and Derbycon (Louisville). There are also countless B-Side conferences throughout the country. Just searching the local MeetUps will provide a list. Cutting edge security is learned by being involved and communicating.</p>

<p>Next, find what you want to do in cybersecurity. Though you might want to take the first job that comes your way, you need to figure out what part of security you want as your career. Saying you want to do security, is like saying you want to work in computers. Figure out if you want to be an analyst, ethical hacker, certifier or network security engineer.</p>

<p>Once you know what you want to do, start lining up formal classes, certificate sessions and informal training. Though CISSP is a common requirement for most jobs, it will not separate you from other candidates. You need to show additional focus, such as ethical hacker and capture-the-flag experience, to make you stand out.</p>

<p>It's also important to remove what you do not want to do. When I graduated, I put my English minor on resumes. With a computer science degree, every employer wanted me to write documentation. When I started looking for my second job, I removed my English minor and removed all the documentation work I did, focusing on the software testing and coding. That was the last documentation job I had. When you first start working we look for things to add to your resume, but as one matures we make our resumes focused on what we want to do and what showcases who we are.</p>
{% endexpandable %}

{% expandable title:"What inspired you to get your master’s in computer science?" %}
<p>I liked War Games, and that was the simple reason why I chose computer science. When I started graduate school: gopher was more popular than HTML, people used "talk" to chat, and "sendmail" was cutting edge. Code writing was focused on algorithms and structure. Hacking was more about talking to others and finding new operating features. To get on the internet from most campus computers, you could do a manual command and then at the colon prompt request a shell.</p>

<p>I was not fortunate enough to go straight to graduate school after finishing my undergraduate. I worked full time and started taking night classes. When I first started in computer security, there were no degrees in security. A master’s degree was actually required by some organizations in order to do what is called penetration testing today.</p>

<p>To me, a computer science master was the key to get a job that was more creative and interesting. While most of the coders I knew had jobs coding database interfaces, I was able to get jobs that involved network design and red teaming. A master’s degree kept me in more cutting-edge jobs.</p>{% endexpandable %}

{% expandable title:"Why is information security such an important topic in our modern society?" %}
<p>We have progressed from the industrial age to the information age, and now to the autonomous age. Security has changed from protecting data to protecting devices. It’s obvious that everything from cars to internal medical devices requires security.</p>

<p>As an information society, being able to control information is a foundational need. In the industrial day, the control of actions was performed by people using machines. Securing industry was about physical security and trusting people. But in the autonomous age, the internet-of-things, people manage decisions. Systems implement action without people. This is how companies and governments can scale.</p>

<p>Information security is about how to control these scaled devices. While we use to worry about controlling secrets, we now must maintain a greater control on who controls devices.</p>
{% endexpandable %}

{% expandable title:"Why is information security an exciting and/or lucrative industry to join right now?" %}
<p>The security industry talks about a shortage of people, mostly in security analyst. It’s a good fit for a career as security analysts are normally entry to mid-level positions. The key to making it both interesting and lucrative is to change to a more technical position in other related security activities. It would be a mistake to think about moving up-the-chain in an operations center. There are already a high-number of managers that have moved laterally from an organization’s IT department.</p>

<p>I think there is more to security than just a good job. Security is a rare job based on competition. One side is trying to enforce security, while another is actively trying to defeat it. Both sides are extremely well funded, and this makes for incredible jumps in technology.</p>

<p>However, security is not just about security. Every new technology feature changes how security works. While iPhones are now implementing augmented reality, there is going to be a need on how to secure it. Security is always being dragged into every technological advancement.</p>

{% endexpandable %}

{% expandable title:"In your opinion, will this industry grow as time goes on? Will there be a higher demand for security analysts?" %}
<p>Security analysts as we know it today will disappear in the next 10 years. Automated processes that perform validation can scale while hiring more people cannot. There is too much business in solving this scalability problem. This is always the issue with information technology and technology jobs, that everything you learn the first year in college is outdated by the time you graduate.</p>

<p>But security is like math. Each succeeding generation of technology is better understood by knowing the previous technology. The fundamentals of security have not changed. Knowing the fundamentals and learning how to apply them to a problem is timeless. This is why higher education is desired by employers. We know that the technology changes, but the processes to understand and resolve problems is the true skill that advanced education provides.</p>

{% subnav_item %} <h2>Educational Paths to Becoming a Information Security Analyst</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}

<p>While there are many paths to enter the information security field, almost all of them include a degree from an accredited college. Most security jobs require the combination of education and hands-on experience that only comes from a comprehensive information security program, and this is typically the only way to advance in the industry.</p>

<h3>What Degree is Needed to Become an Information Security Analyst?</h3>
<p>The typical education requirement for an information security position is a bachelor’s degree in computer science, programming, or another relevant IT field. While an associate degree may lead to some career opportunities, a bachelor’s is typically the minimum requirement for most IT careers. A bachelor's degree also prepares students for career advancement. A computer science degree is appropriate for the field, particularly if it includes coursework in information security. Some colleges also offer dedicated degrees in information security, which can lead to greater opportunities in the field.</p>

<p>Upper-level positions may require you to hold a master’s degree in computer science or a related field, such as an MBA in information systems. These two-year degrees offer a deeper understanding of the field and more specialized knowledge. Graduates are prepared for leadership positions in cyber security. Most master’s degrees also include a significant internship or practicum component, which builds professional experience and makes you more desirable to employers.</p>

<h3>Internships for Information Security Analysts</h3>
<p>A professional internship is often part of the curriculum for an information security degree, at the undergraduate and graduate level. Internships typically take place in a professional environment, such as a business or government agency. They provide students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and apply knowledge outside of the classroom. Internships typically occupy a set number of hours per week and fit your class schedule.</p>

<p>Many schools include optional or mandatory internships within their information security curriculum, though you can also pursue internship opportunities independently. These opportunities are typically more about building professional experience than bringing home a paycheck, but some of the more prestigious internships are paid. In many cases, internships translate into college credit, but even when they don’t, these experiences offer opportunities to network and make professional connections.</p>

<h3>Information Security Certifications</h3>
{% certifications %}
{% certification title:"CompTIA Security+" icon:icon-award %}
<p>Recognized worldwide, the <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompTIA Security+</a> certification covers topics such as compliance and operation security, identity management, and host security. The 90-minute, multiple-choice certification exam is recommended for IT professionals with at least two years of security experience.</p>
