  {% subnav_item %}<h2>What is a Business Analytics Degree?</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
  <p>The term 'business analytics' refers to the methodical investigation of organizational data in order to evaluate a company's
    year-to-year performance and enact measures that optimize daily operations. Analytics is concentrated in data, statistics,
    and predictive modeling. Many graduates who leave school with a master's degree in business analytics go on to become management
    analysts; the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects this profession will
    <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/management-analysts.htm#tab-1"
      target="_blank">grow by 14% between 2014 and 2024</a>, resulting in more than 103,000 new positions. Other potential career paths include
    marketing analysts, information security analysts, and project managers. </p>

<em><strong>How We Ranked the Schools</strong></em>

<p>To determine the best business analytics programs, we looked at common predictors of future success and a school’s commitment
  to online programs. The rankings analyzed two major components: affordability (50%) and academics (50%). This includes
  graduate enrollment, retention rate, loan default rate, in-state graduate tuition, and average 10 year earnings. All data
  points are taken from information provided by colleges and universities though a survey to the National Center for Education
  Statistics.</p>

  {% subnav_item %}<h2>What Else Can I Expect From a Master’s Degree in Business Analytics?</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
  <p>At the college level, students pursuing degrees in business analytics will learn the various analytical procedures for different
    areas of business, such as marketing, finance, pricing, supply chain, and transportation. The coursework also prepares
    them to use statistical data in predictive modeling, manage analytical projects, and drive improvements for their employers.
    Some schools offer dedicated master's degrees in business analytics (or similar fields, such as data science), while others
    allow students to earn an analytics specialization as part of a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. Most business
    analytics master's programs culminate in a capstone project, which typically takes the form of either an individual research
    project or a team presentation.</p>

  <h3>What’s The Difference Between an MS in Business Analytics and an MBA in Business Analytics?</h3>
  <p>Although they share a name, there are some key differences between the 'MBA in Business Analytics' and the Master of Science
    in Business Analytics pathways. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>MBA in Business Analytics:</strong> This is considered an MBA specialization. As such, the curriculum will include a
      handful of courses dedicated to topics like analytics and data science, database administration, and predictive modeling.
      The rest of the program will consist of courses in other areas of business administration, such as management, business
      law, finance and accounting, marketing and sales, human resources, and supply chain logistics. This pathway will be a
      suitable option for students who aspire to become corporate leaders with an analytics specialty, as well as IT managers.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>M.S. in Business Intelligence:</strong> The Master of Science (M.S.) in Business Analytics will be primarily dedicated
      to topics in analytics and data science, such as data mining, workflow analysis, and analytics concentrated in marketing,
      supply chain, finance, and other niche business fields. The curriculum often includes labs and other types of hands-on
      training. Because the coursework generally does not include studies in management and corporate leadership, graduates
      with an M.S. in Business Analytics are often considered for non-supervisory roles at companies and organizations; with
      a master's degree, they may advance to leadership positions after gaining some experience in this field.</li>
  </ul>
  {% subnav_item %}<h2>What is Required to Get into a Master’s in Business Analytics Program?</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
  <p>The requirements for admission into a master's in business analytics degree program will depend on the institution, so it's
    important for students to carefully research the policies of each prospective school. Typical requirements include the
    following: </p>
  {% icon_content icon:icon-coin-stack %}
    <strong>Application and Application Fee:</strong> Applications are standard for virtually all colleges and universities, but the
    requested information will vary. Expect to provide personal contact details and financial information, as well as a brief
    academic/professional history and responses to essay prompts (see below). The application fee will also vary; most range
    from $30 to $60 per application.
  {% endicon_content %}
  {% icon_content icon:icon-clipboard %}
    <strong>Essay/Personal Statement:</strong> Some applications will ask applicants to describe their reasons for choosing that particular
    school, or provide an outline of their career goals. Others will feature an essay prompt, and request the applicant to craft
    a response. Most applications feature a total of two to five essay and/or personal statement assignments.
  {% endicon_content %}
  {% icon_content icon:icon-paper %}
    <strong>Resume/CV:</strong> A resume should outline the applicant's employment history. A detailed summary of the applicant's last
    three to four positions should be included, as well as any notable achievements in these roles. A CV or cover letter is used
    to introduce the resume; applicants should always provide a CV/cover letter unless specifically instructed not to do so.
  {% endicon_content %}
  {% icon_content icon:icon-door %}
    <strong>Interview:</strong> Many graduate programs require applicants to participate in a phone or in-person interview with a faculty
    member or school official. Like a job interview, it's important for candidates to research their program beforehand and come
    to the interview armed with questions about specific aspects of the school and degree pathway. Rehearse answers to a few
    standard interview questions, and try to be and relaxed and engaging as possible.
  {% endicon_content %}
  {% icon_content icon:icon-calculator %}
    <strong>Standardized Tests:</strong> Many grad school programs require students to submit GRE scores, and select MBA programs may
    ask for GMAT scores instead. For more details on these exams, please scroll to the next section.

{% endbackground %}

<h3>Is The GMAT or GRE Required to get Into a Master’s in Business Analytics Program?</h3>
<p>Graduate students seeking a master's in business analytics should expect to sit for at least one standardized exam in order
  to be considered for admission into their program. In most cases, this exam will be either the Graduate Record Examinations
  (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).</p>

<p>Administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS), the GRE consists of four sections. The first two ― Verbal Reasoning and
  Quantitative Reasoning (math) ― are scored out of a range of 130 to 170 points. The third section features two essays,
  an 'issue task' and an 'argument task'; this entire section is scored out of 0 to 6 points. The fourth 'Experimental' section
  consists of verbal and/or math questions that are designed to be used in future exams, and will not count toward the exam-taker's
  score. However, the Experimental section is not labeled, and exam-takers will not be able to differentiate this section
  from the others. For this reason, GRE candidates are encouraged to treat all sections as if they count toward the final
  score. The GRE takes roughly three and a half hours to complete; the exam cost is $195, and scores are valid for five years.
  The GRE is available as a standard paper or computer-adaptive exam; paper exams are widely available, but the computer-adaptive
  options may be limited to designated testing centers. Exam-takers can register online, over the phone, or by mail. A full
  list of possible test dates is <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/register/centers_dates/" target="_blank">available online</a>.</p>

%} The GRE is available as a standard paper or computer-adaptive exam; paper exams are widely available, but the computer-adaptive
options may be limited to designated testing centers.
{% endcallout %}

<p>Administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT features four sections: a 30-minute Analytical
  Writing section; a 30-minute Integrated Reasoning (data analysis) section; a 75-minute Quantitative (math) section, and
  a 75-minute Verbal section. The Quantitative and Verbal sections are scored on a 0-60 and 0-51 point range, respectively;
  only these two sections will count toward the overall score of 200 to 800 points, which is derived incrementally. Analytical
  Writing is scored out of 0 to 6 points, and Integrated Reasoning is scored out of 1 to 8 points; both of these sections
  will be scored separately. Students must sign up for GMAT exams at designated testing centers. They are allowed to take
  the exam no more than once every 16 days. Exam-takers will provide a list of schools where their GMAT scores should be
  sent; upon completing the exam, they will be able to view their score and choose to cancel it or have it sent to the schools
  on their list. The GRE takes roughly three and a half hours to complete; the exam cost is $250, and scores are valid for
  five years.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the GRE has been used to screen graduate school applicants, while the GMAT is used to evaluate business school
  applicants. However, a growing number of business schools have begun to faze out the GMAT requirement and request GRE scores
  instead. Additionally, some colleges and universities do not require a standardized test score of any kind. Students should
  always defer to requirements of schools where they plan to send applications. In some cases, it may be wise to sit for
  both exams.</p>

{% subnav_item %}<h2>Paying for a Master’s in Business Analytics Degree</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}

<p>The cost of business analytics degree programs vary by institution, but even the cheapest options represent a significant
  financial investment for students. This next section will look at some of the expected costs of a business analytics master's
  program, as well as some options for applying for and receiving financial aid support. </p>

<h3>How Much Does a Master’s in Business Analytics Cost?</h3>

<table>
  <caption>Average Graduate Tuition and Fees</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Private Nonprofit</th>
      <th>Public</th>
      <th>For-Profit</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>{% pullquote float:right %} Public universities tend to be the cheapest option because they are funded through the federal government. {% endpullquote %}
As indicated in the table above, the cost of earning a master's in business analytics will
  depend on whether the student attends a private, public, of for-profit institution. Public universities tend to be the
  cheapest option because they are funded through the federal government. They offer larger campuses, but class sizes are
  generally larger and the student-to-faculty ratio is more extreme. Private colleges, on the other hand, are primarily funded
  through student tuition payments and private donations. As a result, they are usually the most expensive option; their
  campuses are smaller, but classes are more inclusive and the student-to-faculty ratios are smaller. For-profit colleges
  are essentially degree-granting institutions that function as businesses with the primary goal of earning positive returns
  for major stakeholders. They are typically more expensive than public universities, and cheaper than private colleges.</p>

<p>Other factors may impact how much students pay in tuition, such as state residency and financial aid. Students must also
  cover additional costs, such as administrative fees, textbooks, and course materials, as well as living accommodations,
  meals, transportation, and parking.</p>

<h3>Financial Aid</h3>

<p>To mitigate the high cost of earning a master's degree, many grad students turn to federal financial aid. Determining their
  eligibility for certain types of aid ― as well as calculating how much they will be qualified to receive ― can be a tricky
  process. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can be a helpful tool during this process. By completing
  and submitting this application, students will receive detailed information about how much aid they will receive based
  on their personal and family income, academic achievements, and other criteria. A <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">printable copy of this form</a>. is available online. Most institutions require students to re-submit a FAFSA for each
  academic year they are enrolled. </p>

{% callout background:"https://res.cloudinary.com/highereducation/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1515002233/BusinessAnalytics.com/Degrees/BA-banner-color2.jpg" %}
Although undergraduate students represent the largest pool of federal financial aid recipients, there are several federal aid opportunities open to grad students as well. Master's degree students seeking federal loans have two options.
{% endcallout %}

<p><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized" target="_blank">Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a>. are available to graduate students without demonstrating financial need; the recipient's
  school will determine how much money they can borrow based on their enrollment level and other financial aid they have
  received; the current maximum amount for these loans is $20,500 per year. Recipients will be required to pay interest immediately;
  those who do not make payments while they are in school will see their interest accrued and added to the principal amount
  of their loan. The fixed interest for Direct Unsubsidized Loans is 6%. Grad students do not qualify for Direct Subsidized
  Loans.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/plus" target="_blank">Direct PLUS Loans</a>. are available to grad students who do not have an 'adverse credit history' and are completing a
  degree or certificate program. In addition to submitting a FAFSA, many schools require candidates to request a Direct PLUS
  Loan at <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action?_ga=2.7756785.2110342780.1499808453-801505971.1499808453" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a>. Like Direct Unsubsidized Loans, the recipient's school will determine how much money they can borrow based on attendance and other financial aid resources. Students will not need to begin repaying their Direct PLUS Loan until six months after graduating or leaving their master's program; the fixed interest rate for Direct PLUS Loans is 7%. </p>

<p>Additionally, grad students may apply for grants and/or scholarships to cover costs related to their master's in business
  analytics program. Federal grants and scholarships are not available to graduate students, but plenty of opportunities
  are offered through private companies, nonprofit organizations, colleges and universities, and other sources. Many scholarships
  and grants are exclusively available to students in certain academic areas of study; business analytics master's-seekers
  are encouraged to apply to awards that prioritize business studies.</p>

{% subnav_item %}<h2>Accreditation for Business Analytics Programs</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}

<p>Accreditation is a critical factor when researching institutions for master's in business analytics programs. The term accreditation
  refers to an extensive vetting process colleges and universities must undergo in order to be considered legitimate educational
  providers. The vetting is conducted by accreditation-granting organizations (also known as accreditors), who evaluate each
  school based on course curricula, faculty experience, campus resources, student outcomes, and tuition costs, among other
  criteria. The accreditation process can last months ― up to a year, in some cases. Schools must renew their accreditation
  status every few years. If they fail to do so, or accreditors find the school does not meet their academic criteria, then
  the school will lose its accreditation status. At this time, its credits will become non-transferrable, and students will
  not receive federal financial aid for attending them.</p>

<p>Currently, accreditation is divided into three primary categories. The first, regional accreditation, is awarded to schools
  that provide academic degrees. Six regional accreditors provide this type of accreditation to colleges and universities
  across the U.S. located in their area of jurisdiction. The second, national accreditation, if typically conferred to technical
  colleges, vocational schools, and for-profit institutions. A total of 10 accreditors provide national accreditation in
  the U.S. Most academic experts agree that regional accreditation is superior to national accreditation; the standards for
  the latter are considered more relaxed than those of the former. The third type of accreditation is known as programmatic
  accreditation, and is reserved for academic subdivisions at colleges and universities that specialize in one academic field,
  such as business, nursing, medicine, or law. Programmatic accreditation almost always applies to programs at the graduate
  level, since these academic subdivisions mostly provide master's and Ph.D. programs. Those researching master's degree
  in business analytics programs should ensure that all schools on their list have received the proper regional/national
  and/or programmatic accreditation, and that their status is current. </p>

<p>Two bodies recognize accreditation agencies in United States: the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), which is part of the
  federal government; and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), a non-profit organization. It's important
  to note that neither the DOE nor the CHEA award accreditation directly; rather, they evaluate the accreditors responsible
  for doing so. To learn more about all recognized accreditors, please visit the full lists provided by the <a href="https://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/GetDownLoadFile.aspx" target="_blank">DOE</a> and the <a href="http://www.chea.org/4DCGI/cms/review.html?Action=CMS_Document&DocID=32&MenuKey=main" target="_blank">CHEA</a>.</p>

{% background bgcolor:#FAFAFA bordertop:#dee2e7 borderbottom:#dee2e7 %}
  {% subnav_item %}<h2>Scholarships</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
  <p>There is no shortage of scholarship and grant opportunities for students in the United States, although opportunities are
    slightly more limited for those at the graduate level. Some scholarships and grants are non-renewable, meaning they provide
    a single payout; others are renewable, and will provide money to recipients on an annual or semi-annual basis. Scholarships
    and grants will also vary in terms of eligibility requirements, award amount, and other details. Four scholarships open
    to master's in business analytics students are outlined in the boxes below. </p>
