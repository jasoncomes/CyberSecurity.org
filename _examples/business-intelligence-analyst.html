  {% subnav_item %}<h2>What is a Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst?</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
  <p>Behind every business decision is a savvy business intelligence (BI) analyst. Accurate data is a valuable commodity that
    drives business solutions, which is why BI analysts are in such high demand. These data-driven professionals deliver actionable
    insights about company and industry trends to improve operational efficiency and financial performance. Ranked by
    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ekgkh/no-9-business-intelligence-analyst/#71aaa09c244e"
      target="_blank">Forbes</a> as one of the top-paying jobs in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), well-qualified
    BI analysts can expect to enter lucrative industries such as healthcare, banking and finance, e-commerce, software and
    technology, insurance, and manufacturing.</p>
  <h3>What Does a BI Analyst Do?</h3>
  <p>BI analysts use technical expertise and business acumen to paint the "big picture", leveraging data to improve a company's
    bottom line. Because they model and interpret large amounts of information, the average BI analyst may need programming
    skills (e.g., proficiency in SQL, Cognos, or other BI-specific software), a talent for data mining and visualization, as
    well as knowledge in statistical and quantitative methodologies. Every piece of data needs a voice, which is why communications
    skills are a must. On any given day, a BI analyst might be writing reports for company principals, meeting with developers
    to improve data storage structures, or giving a presentation on performance metrics to reduce costs.</p>

<h3>Types of Business Analysts</h3>

<p>While a good catch-all term, "business intelligence analyst" doesn't capture the wide range of positions that fall into the
  category of business intelligence and analytics. Some positions are more technical, requiring fluency in quantitative methods
  or software proficiency, whereas others require traditional business know-how. Responsibilities may vary depending on the
  industry, business domain, technology used, and project requirements.
</p>

<h4>Management Analyst</h4>
<p>Distinct from positions that evaluate market trends and strategies, management analysts tackle internal processes involving
  human resources, budgets, procedures, equipment, and facilities. Management analysts plan and coordinate projects to streamline
  diverse administrative and management operations. They may also conduct analytical studies and prepare reports, surveys,
  and manuals to ensure compliance with best practices. A typical business management analyst evaluates staff to ensure that
  the work performed matches the company's internal logic and product delivery standards.

<h4>Healthcare Analyst</h4>
<p>Healthcare business analysts are some of the most in-demand professionals in the business intelligence sphere, accounting
  for around
  <a href="https://www.healthschoolguide.net/health-careers/healthcare-analyst/" target="_blank">18%</a> of job listings. They are typically well-educated in healthcare administration and are fluent in healthcare management
  systems. By compiling and analyzing data, healthcare analysts improve how health services are rendered at hospitals and
  other healthcare agencies. They may also monitor and analyze current trends in the healthcare industry to ensure the services
  provided are in-step with best practices.

<h4>Technical Analyst</h4>
<p>Technical analysts are number crunchers and need to possess a solid understanding of finance as well as statistical and quantitative
  methods. Because of the expertise required, some states require certification to work as a qualified technical analyst.
  The typical BI analyst in this role engages in financial forecasting by analyzing fluctuations in the stock market. Technical
  analysts use information like interest rates, stock prices, and trading volume to determine when to sell stocks, and to
  assess and predict favorable market conditions for employers.

<h4>Functional Analyst</h4>
<p>Functional analysts are subject matter experts, which commonly entails technical specialization in areas such as information
  technology or computer science (including software fluency), or specialization in particular industries. While the job
  requirements of functional analysts will vary, many analysts evaluate current technologies and research emerging technologies;
  design, maintain, and upgrade existing computer systems; and oversee product development to ensure it meets organizational
  requirements.

<h4>Agile Analyst</h4>
<p>Being an agile business analyst means using business analysis in an agile environment, which usually refers to agile software
  environments where a project depends on collaborative decision making. Agile environments operate with values essential
  for cross-functional teams: innovation, leadership, empathy, business orientation, and anticipation. A company will typically
  seek agile business analysts when the project requirements evolve over time — requiring flexibility — and where interaction
  with end users influences how a product is designed.

      {% expandable title:"Why is business analytics such an important topic in our modern society?" active:true %}
        <p>Since the development of Google and social media around 15 years ago, our society has moved into a 4th stage of growth
          and exponentially increasing productivity, globally. The Agricultural Revolution of the 1600s led to the Industrial
          Revolution of the 1700s which led to Information Technology Revolution, ie from computer hardware, to software, World
          Wide Web starting in the 1960s. Google brought us the Conceptual Revolution, and sophisticated search analytics, through
          "big data", among other developments, to uncover patterns of behaviors, themes and history -- across many different
          industries, countries, cultures and help us PRIORITIZE which problems to solve and opportunities to exploit in our
          business, going forward.
        </p>
        <p>Today's "Business Analytics", is a big advance over "Risk-Management Analytics" which often twists available mathematical
          data to find some sort of solution to limit loss, which may or may not be appropriate to the market situation. Banks
          used risk-management analytics for years to protect them from losses … then came the credit crunch of 2008/09 ... how
          did that work out for them ? In contrast, Business Analytics helps us construct the value-added QUESTIONS to ask and
          then resolve. Simply, compared to Business Analytics, risk management is so turn-of-the-century.</p>
      {% endexpandable %}
      {% expandable title:"Why is business analytics an exciting and/or lucrative industry to join right now?" %}
        <p>Business Analytics increases our work productivity a hundredfold. For example, imagine you and work colleague are discussing
          a debt financing done years ago. You say it was for $500 million, your colleagues says it was for $50 million. The
          answer will determine whether you take one course of action or its opposite. Before Google, you might never find the
          answer through web search. Or worse, you might have to research library publications ! This could take hours/days !
          Now, in seconds you can end the dispute -- "sources financing was for 500 million, done 2010". Think of the value created
          by insightful, well researched, business analytics timely produced for clients. And with coming technological improvements,
          it can only get better. Time is money.</p>
      {% endexpandable %}
      {% expandable title:"How will the course your school offers give students a leg up in their career?" %}
        <p>I'm developing a course in Business Analytics, patterned after my a credit derivatives course I taught at NYU before
          and during the financial crisis; "CDS 101". I canvassed several students and found existing credit derivatives courses
          focused on mathematical formulae designed to limit risk. Unfortunately, they never discussed history – how we got from
          banking in the 1980s – through today, where everyone trades all types of debt instruments and derivatives, everywhere
          in the world. I focused largely on history, enabled students to develop correct questions, i.e. "is the product priced
          correctly ?", and helped them and their employers avoid the worst of the credit crunch losses.</p>
      {% endexpandable %}
      {% expandable title:"In your opinion, will this industry grow as time goes on? Will there be a higher demand for business analysts?" %}
        <p>Business Analytics will grow in modern financial institutions and will become more popular than risk-management analytics
          because it looks for opportunities in the broadest sense, in addition to looking to performance, to mitigate risk and
          prevent loss. Business Analytics uses historical data, but also contemporaneous data -- e.g. where customers are located,
          with their income is, what comparable products/services they are attracted to -- to identify what types of products/services
          the customer needs, to maximize business opportunities and returns to shareholders. Business Analytics focuses on Conceptual
          Thinking, rather than numerical data and quantitative relationships of the past.</p>
      {% endexpandable %}
      {% expandable title:"What advice would you give to someone looking to begin their career in business analytics?" %}
        <p>I would encourage students to get comfortable with basic statistics, advanced algebra – but most importantly – take lots
          of humanities courses -- microeconomics, history, government/political science, literature; travel and live overseas
          if they can for a while -- so that they have a "holistic" background -- which will be ideal during today's Conceptual
          Revolution". Become familiar with other countries and cultures because your best opportunities may come overseas (e.g.
          whether American going to China, or Chinese coming to America) in the Conceptual Revolution.</p>

{% subnav_item %}<h2>Educational Paths to Becoming a BI Analyst</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}

<p>While there are many different pathways to becoming a BI analyst, the responsibilities entailed therein can be quite rigorous
  in terms of the knowledge and skills required, particularly if the position is more technically oriented. Many employers
  will require an accredited degree program that equips students with a business mindset and prepares them for building and
  analyzing large volumes of information. Having a degree is therefore the best option for becoming a licensed, experienced
  BI analyst.
</p>

<h3>What Degree is Needed to Become a BI Analyst?</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, employers expect incoming BI analysts to possess at least a bachelor’s degree in business intelligence,
  computer science, or business administration with a focus on data science and computer information technology. Higher-level
  positions may call for graduate degrees such as a Master of Business Administration or a Master of Science degree in specialized
  fields like finance or computer science. This is because degree programs related to business intelligence and analytics
  are known to equip students with programming skills for building and maintaining databases, statistical skills for analyzing
  trends, and communications skills for presenting complex information to diverse stakeholders.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that, particularly for later-stage career development, a degree without specific technology- or industry-specific
  skills and certifications may not be enough to satisfy all job requirements. To become a healthcare analyst, for example,
  several years of experience in healthcare administration may be necessary. Similarly, job advertisements for financial
  or technical analysts may require certification or a strong familiarity with finance-specific software applications, and
  agile business analysts may be expected to have stronger programming skills since they work routinely with teams of software
  developers and managers.
</p>

<h3>Internships for Business Analysts</h3>

<p>Internships are fixed-period assignments, either paid or unpaid, that are intended to train students and recent graduates
  in the same skills they would otherwise use as full-time employees. Interns usually work for three to six months at a company
  to gain valuable exposure to the responsibilities and expectations common to their industry of choice, and may or may not
  gain full-time employment at the conclusion of their internship.
</p>
<p>In the case of prospective business intelligence analysts, internships are a valuable tool not only for gaining potential
  college credit, but for the hands-on experience not attainable from a traditional degree program. Business intelligence
  interns can expect to work at multiple levels, including research and analysis, collecting and interpreting data, and learning
  the ropes of basic business management. Common duties might include helping to draft reports, analyzing business requirements,
  preparing research presentations, and assisting with miscellaneous administrative tasks.
</p>

<h3>Business Intelligence Certifications</h3>

{% certifications %}
  {% certification title:"The Certified Management Consultant™ (CMC®)" icon:icon-award %}
    <p>The CMC requires a bachelor’s degree and ensures those who earn certification are well-trained in standards for ethics and technical proficiency, project management, consulting, and related professional behavior.

  {% endcertification %}
  {% certification title:"Certified Business Analysis Professional (CBAP®)" icon:icon-award %}
    <p>Applicants for full CBAP certification must have at least five years or 7,500 hours of business analysis experience. Through a series of scenario-based and case-study questions, applicants apply their professional experience to imagined situations and demonstrate their ability to synthesize knowledge and information.</p>
  {% endcertification %}
  {% certification title:"PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PBA)" icon:icon-award %}
    <p>The PBA exam consists of 200 multiple-choice questions on subjects including: needs assessment, planning, analysis, traceability and monitoring, and evaluation. The PMI is intended for those who work with teams and manage the product development process, including project requirements. In essence, the certification is for project and program managers whose core function is business analysis.</p>
