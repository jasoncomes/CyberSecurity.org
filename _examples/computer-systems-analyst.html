{% expandables %} {% expandable title:"Why is business analytics such an important topic for modern society?" active:true %}
<p>Data has always been central to society. According to the National Archives, the census is older than the Chinese, Egyptian, Greek and Roman civilizations, dating back to the Babylonians in 4000 BC. Incans -- maybe as early has 5,000 years ago -- wore quipu, a wearable data storage and communications system that told a person’s whole financial story. Why? Because where society spends its resources is critical to making sure we are using our scarce resources wisely as well as for helping to inform long-term decisions. As a 200 year-old engineering focused company, data analysis is the lifeblood of everything we do at thyssenkrupp.
</p>
<p>Within my Strategy, Markets and Development team we focus on projects to drive value to our businesses and help us better serve our customers. Recently we conducted a segmentation of our customers for one of our businesses. We realized that roughly 20% of our 20,000+ customers drive nearly 80% of sales. By using this information we were able to drive better customer engagement with our top tier customers while delivering a differentiated level of service based on customer segments which helped improve overall satisfaction as well as the performance of our business.
</p>{% endexpandable %}
{% expandable title:"Why is business analytics an exciting and/or lucrative industry to join right now?" %}

<p>As an analyst you can work on high impact projects that drive real value to business. Companies today hire many different types of analysts (e.g. Financial, Risk, Supply Chain, etc.) based on the specific business function requirements. These analysts play a crucial role in helping senior management understand how their business is performing and how they can improve. Within my team we spend a lot of time doing various types of analyses like customer segmentation, profitability, supply chain optimization and forecasting. The projects help us find ways to better serve our customers or reduce inefficiencies within a given process.
</p>

<p>For example, one of thyssenkrupp’s automotive businesses has to deliver components to our customers JIT (just in time). If this critical part is not available to the customer in time the entire production line can shut down causing millions in delays. The team was able to improve our business’s process by analyzing its workflow. We helped reduce inventory by 20% while still being able to meet the very high levels of service demanded by our customers.
</p>{% endexpandable %}
{% expandable title:"How will the course your school offers give students a leg up in their career?" %}

<em>Contributor’s Note: As a corporate entity thyssenkrupp does not offer public courses but here are thoughts on which types of courses are valuable to me as a team leader and consultant.</em>

Get experience working with large data sets either through experiences such as coursework or internships, etc. The larger the data, the better. And, real-world data is ideal because it has more ambiguity and is more realistic. Get familiar with the latest tools and techniques in the field, software like Tableau, Microsoft BA and Microstrategy; learn their pros and cons. Courses in statistics, business data analysis and modeling, supply chain management, R & Python programming can be useful. Excel and Access are valuable lifelong tools that can serve you well in any industry or position.
{% endexpandable %}
{% expandable title:"In your opinion, will this industry grow as time goes on? Will there be a higher demand for business analysts?" %}

Gartner predicts this year, 2017, 8.4 billion connected “things” will be in use and the number will reach 20.4 billion by 2020. Total spending on endpoints and services will reach almost $2 trillion this year as well. As we gather information from every imaginable device – at thyssenkrupp we collect data on tens of thousands of elevators a day – data has seeped into every part of our lives. The person and teams who understand how to decipher this content can inform the strategy of any part of any type of business. Critical roles include business analysts, data scientists and data architects. But, I also see business analysis skills astutely employed by innovators in R&D and the most cutting-edge global leaders.
{% endexpandable %}
{% expandable title:"What advice would you give someone looking to begin their careers in business analytics?" %}

Data analysis does not have to be an endpoint. Be curious. Business analysis is driven by understanding how things work and can be improved or applied to other problems. Challenge yourself to connect the dots, to understand the purpose of the business challenge and what information drives this strategy. Talk to people who are or have worked as business analysts and hear their insights.

{% subnav_item %} <h2>Educational Paths to Becoming a Computer Systems Analyst</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
Most computer systems analyst positions require employees to hold, at minimum, a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college. While there’s plenty of learning on the job, many positions require the combination of education and hands-on experience that a college program offers.

<h3>What Degree is Needed to Become a Computer Systems Analyst?</h3>

A bachelor’s degree in a computer science or a related area, such as information systems, is required for most computer systems analyst positions. Since systems analyst work is intertwined with business, taking business courses or minoring in business makes you more desirable to employers. Some positions require a master’s degree; many systems analysts hold an MBA with a specialization in information systems or a related IT field. For more technical positions, a master’s in computer science might be more appropriate.

<h3>Internships for Computer Systems Analysts</h3>

An internship builds professional experience and potential career connections. They typically require students and professionals to work a set number of hours each week and relate to course learning. Most internships are unpaid, but the more competitive options are often paid.

A systems analyst internship allows you to gain experience in a professional IT environment, performing entry-level work and seeing how the industry operates. Internships are typically available at a variety of locations and can usually be arranged through your school or independently. Most schools offer course credit for students who complete an internship, and some programs (particularly at the master’s level) require a certain number of internship hours as part of the curriculum.
