{% subnav_item %} <h2>What is an Online Business Analytics Certification?</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
<p>The field of business analytics involves the iterative analysis and exploration of organizational data in order to evaluate day-to-day operations, make strategic decisions, and set company goals related to profit, productivity, efficiency, and employee satisfaction. Analytics is practiced across a wide range of industries, and candidates with this skill are often considered in high demand.</p>
<p>Many analytics professionals prepare themselves for this career by earning a bachelor's degree in business analytics or a related field, such as information systems management or database administration. However, many gain the necessary knowledge and skills by earning an online certification, rather than completing a four-year degree program. Online analytics certifications can also supplement an employee's undergraduate credentials, and potentially lead to higher salaries and advancement opportunities. In addition, the structure of online certification programs may be more conducive to students who wish to study analytics but have full-time jobs, childcare duties, and other obligations that prevent them from attending a brick-and-mortar campus.  </p>

<h3>Potential Career Paths for Business Analytics Certificate Holders</h3>

<p>Certified analysts typically find jobs in either the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/home.htm" target="_blank">business and financial</a> or <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm" target="_blank">computer and information technology</a> sectors, both of which are projected to experience above-average industry growth and relatively high salaries in the coming years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Below are three common positions that certified analytics professionals typically pursue: </p>

<ul class="resources">
<li><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/management-analysts.htm" target="_blank">Management Analysts</a> Also known as management consultants, management analysts monitor and evaluate the various processes of a company or organization and then deliver their findings to top executives. The data they collect is used to address problems, set goals, and improve different performance metrics related to profits, productivity, efficiency, and employee satisfaction.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-systems-analysts.htm" target="_blank">Computer Systems Analysts</a> Computer systems analysts review their organization's software and hardware systems in order to boost overall performance. They also work with designers and developers to create, evaluate, and implement new tools and platforms. The BLS notes that this career path is projected to grow by 21% between 2014 and 2024.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/operations-research-analysts.htm" target="_blank">Operations Research Analysts</a> Operations research analysts rely on algorithms, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to identify and address problems at their organization.

More than 25% of these professionals work in the finance and insurance industry, while another 23% work in professional, scientific, and technical services.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Certificate to Master's Bridge Programs</h3>

<p>Some business analytics certification online options are classified as 'master's bridge programs'. This means that their curriculum prepares students to immediately enter a graduate degree program as soon as they receive their certification. Students gain foundational knowledge and skills related to analytics and also learn what to expect in a master's-level analytics degree program.</p>

<p>A bridge certificate is not considered a terminal credential, but rather an introduction to the master's in analytics. On the other hand, Graduate certificates are designed for students who want to build on their undergraduate studies without committing to a full graduate degree program.</p>

{% subnav_item %} <h2>Accreditation for Online Certificate Programs</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}

<p>Accreditation is an important concern for anyone wishing to pursue an online business analytics certification. Accreditation refers to the comprehensive vetting process that colleges and universities must undergo in order to receive federal funding and confer transferable credits to students. Accreditation-granting organizations (also known as accreditors) evaluate various aspects of an institution under review, including student outcomes like retention and graduation rates, faculty credentials, and campus resources. The accreditation process can last years, in some cases.</p>

<p>In the U.S., three types of accreditation are awarded to degree-granting institutions. Regional accreditation is bestowed upon nonprofit colleges and universities that award two- and four-year degrees, and emphasize liberal arts. A total of seven regional accreditors oversee this process across the country. National accreditation, on the other hand, is primarily given to vocational and technical colleges, as well as for-profit institutions. A total of 10 national accreditors operate nationwide. The third type of accreditation, programmatic, is awarded to smaller institutions at colleges and universities that award degrees in one academic subject, such as medical, nursing, law, and business schools. In most cases, programmatic accreditation is reserved for master's and doctoral degree programs.</p>

<p>Currently, two bodies oversee postsecondary accreditation in the U.S.: the U.S. Department of Education, a branch of the federal government; and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, a nonprofit organization. Full lists of accreditors recognized by the <a href="https://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/agencies.aspx" target="_blank">Department of Education</a> and <a href="https://www.chea.org/userfiles/recognition/chea_usde_allaccred.pdf" target="_blank">CHEA</a> are available online. </p>

<p>Like most bachelor's degrees, online certifications do not receive programmatic accreditation. For this reason, students should carefully research institutions that provide these certifications to ensure that the school they choose has earned accreditation from a regional or national accreditor recognized by the Department of Education or CHEA. Many schools that offer online certifications receive accreditation through the Distance Education Accrediting Commission, which is a national accreditor.</p>
