  {% subnav_item %}<h2>What is a Budget Analyst?</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}
  <p>From the smallest local business to the largest multinational conglomerate, organizations of all sizes rely on comprehensive
    budgets to make sense of their finances. Budget analysts perform the vital work of developing, monitoring, and analyzing
    overall budgets, offering expert advice that helps companies reach their financial goals. Since all organizations must
    handle their own finances, budget analysts can find employment in almost any industry.</p>
  <h3>What Does a Budget Analyst Do?</h3>
  <p>Budget analysts are responsible for knowing a company's budget inside and out. Organizations depend on these professionals
    for recommendations about everything from spending to resource allocation to funding cuts. While executives and government
    leaders typically have the final say on budget composition, budget analysts play an important part in an organization’s
    financial decision-making process. Other common duties include reviewing budget proposals and funding requests from different
    departments, keeping track of organizational spending, and estimating future budget needs and concerns. Those interested
    in becoming a financial business analyst must have a head for numbers and an eye for detail. Strong communication skills
    are also important because they can help you explain the intricacies of a budget to other team members.</p>
  <h3>Common Responsibilities</h3>
  <ul class="resources-columns">
    <li>
      <strong>Budget Development</strong> One of the major responsibilities of a budget analyst is working alongside program and project
      managers to oversee the development of the organizational budget. This involves examining different departments’ expenses,
      revenue, and performance to help determine future spending needs.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consolidating Interdepartmental Budgets</strong> Each department in an organization has its own budget, which must be
      combined into a consolidated organizational budget to create a comprehensive overview of the organization’s finances.
      Budget analysts are responsible for compiling the consolidated budget and fielding departmental funding requests.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Monitoring Organizational Spending</strong> In addition to developing the budget, it’s crucial to monitor company spending
      closely to ensure than an organization stays financially solvent. One of this professional's most important duties is
      to ensure that organizational spending remains within a fixed budget.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ensuring Legal and Regulatory Compliance</strong> Along with technical knowledge of accounting and budgeting, budget
      analysts also need to have knowledge of financial regulations and ethics, which help to ensure that an organization’s
      budgeting and spending are operating legally. They are responsible for reviewing other manager’s proposals to ensure
      they meet all financial legal standards.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Communicating and Advising Executives</strong> While top executives and other leaders have the final say on the overall
      budget, they depend on the expertise of analysts to make many financial decisions. Budget analysts must frequently communicate
      their findings to executives and department directors in a way that's understandable to non-experts.</li>

{% subnav_item %}<h2>Educational Paths to Becoming a Budget Analyst</h2>{% endsubnav_item %}

<p>While gaining a certain amount of experience in budgeting or finance may sometimes be enough to move into a budget analyst
  position, your best shot is to enroll in an accredited degree program. Earning a degree in budget analysis will provide
  you with the skills and background that are needed for steady employment and career growth.</p>
<h3>What Degree is Needed to Become a Budget Analyst?</h3>
<p>Most budget analyst positions require at least a bachelor’s degree, though more elite employers may desire a master’s degree
  even for their general analysts. Private sector employers desire candidates with a degree in a relevant field, such as
  finance, business, accounting, economics, statistics, or public administration. Government agencies and some private employers
  may be more lenient with degree requirements, as the
  <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/budget-analysts.htm#tab-4"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reports that a degree in political science or sociology may sometimes be adequate to obtain
  a budget analyst position.</p>

<p>For higher-level positions in management, a master’s degree is usually required. Many MBA programs offer concentrations in
  finance or financial analysis and advanced degrees in accounting or statistics may also help you distinguish yourself from
  other applicants.</p>
<h3>Internships for Budget Analysts</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to develop your skills and increase job opportunities is through an internship. Internships are typically
  required in master’s programs, but many undergraduate programs offer them as well. An internship gives you the chance to
  gain professional knowledge in a real finance environment, working under other employees and learning from their experience.
  Internships typically occupy a set number of hours each week and are designed to not overlap with a student's classroom
  schedule. While most internships are unpaid, some of the more prestigious positions may let you take home a paycheck.</p>

<p>Internships are often available as part of a program's curriculum, allowing students to gain academic credit and build work
  experience at the same time. Even those that don’t translate to course credit offer valuable opportunities for learning
  and networking. If your program does not include internships as part of the curriculum, then it’s still usually possible
  to find your own opportunities, either with the help of the school or through your own research.</p>
